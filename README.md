# Superconductivty-regression-problem-with-Decision-tree.
In this repository we will see what is this Superconductivty(regression problem) parameters/variable values and try to fit this values in a Decision tree regression.
there different Metal properties and we need to predict its critical_temp!!

To run the code follow the below steps:

1.Install python(3.6+) and need packages.
```
pip install numpy
```
```
pip instll pandas
```
```
pip install matplotlib
```
```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
```
pip install seaborn
```

2.Clone this repository .
```
https://github.com/karthikeyanthanigai/Superconductivty-regression-problem-with-Decision-tree..git
```
3.Open command line and set the directory to the cloned repository.
```
cd Superconductivty-regression-problem-with-Decision-tree.
```
4.Enter the command.
```
python dec.py
```

if you got any error in install the packages then refer [Stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com).
